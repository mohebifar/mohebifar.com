Today I publish one of my symfony2 bundles.
CalendarBundle is a Symfony2 bundle which helps you to show Datetimes based on a calendar. CalendarBundle uses a strategy that allows you to make your arbitary driver.

Currently drivers are :

 1. Gregorian
 2. Persian (also known as Hejri Khorshidi, Hijri Shamsi (Persian: هجری شمسی, هجری خورشیدی). It is official calendar in Iran)
